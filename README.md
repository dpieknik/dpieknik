<h1>Hi, I'm Daniel! </h1>

<h2>***** NOTE ****</h2>
<h2>Please bare with me as this is a work in progress. I will continue to add my past projects as
I have time to do so. There are many cybersecurity projects, including a breakdown of my homelab,
as well as blurbs about talks I have done and have planned, articles I post, more Python projects,
over a decade of IT work, and other content as new projects come down the pipeline that will make 
their way here for archive. This has certainly been an eye-opening project which has earned its way 
into a blog post. This would not have been so daunting if I had done this earlier in my technology career. 
I will definitely be promoting an early start of a GitHub to my colleagues and students. 
Another "don't do what I did" story for the win :)</h2>
